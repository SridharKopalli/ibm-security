# Layout

To align with [Carbon's documentation and package ecosystem](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon#getting-started), layout-related code now directly references underlying Carbon modules to provide consistency in accessing common functions, mixins, variables, and more.

Also refer to [usage in Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/layout#usage).
